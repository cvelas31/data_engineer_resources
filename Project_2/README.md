# Data Modeling with Cassandra

Sparkify is a start up that wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

In this project we build an ETL pipeline using Python and Apache Cassandra to run queries.
